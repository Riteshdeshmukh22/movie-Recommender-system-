# movie-Recommender-system-
A content-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to a given input movie using NLP and Machine Learning techniques (CountVectorizer + Cosine Similarity). Can be extended to real-world platforms like Netflix or IMDb to improve user experience and engagement.

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries
Programming: Python
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
NLP: NLTK (stemming, stopwords)
ML / Feature Extraction: Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Cosine Similarity)
Development: Jupyter Notebook

#Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Merged movies & credits datasets

Extracted important columns: genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview
Text cleaning, tokenization, stemming

Feature Engineering
Created a combined tags column
Converted text into numerical features with CountVectorizer
Calculated Cosine Similarity to measure closeness between movies

Recommendation System
Input: Movie Title
Output: Top 5 most similar movies based on cosine similarity

#NLP Technologies Used

1.Text Preprocessing
  Cleaning and combining text from genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview into a single column (tags).
  Removing noise/unnecessary text.

2.Tokenization
  Splitting sentences/phrases into tokens (words).

3.Stemming (from NLTK)
  Reducing words to their root form (e.g., “playing” → “play”).
  Helps treat similar words as the same.

4.Vectorization (Feature Extraction)
  Using CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words model) from Scikit-learn.
  Converts text into numerical vectors (word counts).

5.Cosine Similarity
  Measures similarity between movie vectors.
  Higher cosine similarity → movies are more alike.

#Real Life Uses of Movie Recommendation system

1.Streaming Platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+)
  Recommend movies/shows similar to the one the user just watched.
  Increases engagement and watch time.

2.Movie Discovery Apps (IMDb, Letterboxd, TMDB)
  Suggest movies based on a user’s search.

3.E-commerce / Retail (Beyond Movies)
  The same technique (content-based recommendation) can be applied to products, books, songs, or even job portals.
  Example: “People who viewed this product also liked…”

4.Personalized Entertainment Systems
  Smart TVs, recommendation bots, or personal assistants (like Alexa/Google Assistant).
